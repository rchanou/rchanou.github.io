# Original - IIS 6.0 was having issues with the query strings
# For example ,Laravel was picking up "key" as "step1?key"
# RewriteRule ^/booking/(.*)$ /booking/index.php?/$1 [L]

# Updated - Laravel + IIS 6.0 seems to be able to pick up query strings correctly
RewriteRule ^/booking/(.*)$ /booking/index.php/$1 [I,QSA,L]
